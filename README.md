Open the terminal in the client file
Run "npm install axios"

Since I uploaded sub-files, you need to create a new folder, put all these sub-files in it, and then open the terminal in this newly created file

Then enter the instruction


# install dependencies if they aren't there
npm install

# run your development server
npm run dev


If it doesn't work
Please operate the following command to establish the port
Install
$ npm install --save kill-port
# OR
$ yarn add kill-port

CLI
$ npm install --global kill-port
# OR
$ yarn global add kill-port

Then:

$ kill-port --port 8080
Then:

$ kill-port --port 3000

Finally run the instruction again:
# run your development server
npm run dev
